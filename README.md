What is Raspberry?
----------------

Raspberry is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world based on Bitcoin. Raspberry uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Raspberry Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Raspberry Coin Core software, see https://raspberrycoin.org/downloads, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://raspberrycoin.org/raspberrycoin.pdf).

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.
